- "How To Train Your Dragon" is about a Boy named "Hiccup" during the times of the Vikings. The young Boy seems to be so different compared to every Viking around him, yet, he wants to prove that he is just the same as them. In order to do just that, he wanted to hunt at least one of the Viking's long since mortal enemies: The Dragons. And so, he sought out to do just that. *But upon his journey of proving himself, he learned that there is much more to every Dragon than just their war and bloodshed, much more than just their onslaught and violence.*
